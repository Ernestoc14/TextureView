we are gonna use TV to access to the Camera on Android Devices. This is a basic example of how to do it step by step

First we are going to code the MainActivity.java: 
[MainActivity File](https://github.com/Ernestoc14/TextureView/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/textureview/MainActivity.java)

Then you are going to add the permissions to allow Android to use the Camera into the AndroidManifest.xml File

Finally, we are gonna add the TextureView Widget in the activity_main.mxl
[Activity_main.xml](https://github.com/Ernestoc14/TextureView/blob/main/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml)
